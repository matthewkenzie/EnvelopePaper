\begin{abstract}
A common problem in data analysis is measuring a narrow signal on a smoothly
varying background. In cases where the background functional form is not
{\it a priori} known, then some extra uncertainty must be assigned to the
signal parameters because of this lack of knowledge.
A method for assigning an error from this cause is presented. It is based on
treating the function uncertainty as a discrete nuisance parameter and finding
an ``envelope'' which encompasses the lowest log-likelihood values for any given
signal parameter. The bias and coverage of this method are shown to be good.
